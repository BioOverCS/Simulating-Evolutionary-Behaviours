# Simulating Evolutionary Behaviours

Final project for `ICS4U`. This project is a tool to visualize, think about, experiment and understand concepts of heritable traits. Please enjoy â€” I certainly enjoyed making this.

## Running
Running this project may be easiest with the [compiled JAR](Simulating-Evolutionar-Behaviours.jar). You can double click on it or run:
```ps
java -jar "Simulating Evolutionary Behaviours.jar"
```
You can run this project manually by running the [main](src/Main.java) class but that *may* require you to reference the [libraries](lib/jfreechart-1.0.1/lib/) in the class path; I don't know I've only ever ran this on my own computer.
