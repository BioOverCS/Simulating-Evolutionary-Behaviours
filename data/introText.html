<p style="width:600px;">This project is designed to be a tool to visualize, think about, experiment with and understand concepts of heritable traits. Along the way, you will encounter plenty of ideas in population study, evolution, growth, agriculture and more. I encourage you to use any prior knowledge of these ideas to make sense of whatever phenomena may occur. I <i>highly encourage</i> you to think deeply about and make hypotheses on what you think may happen; then experiment, compare the results to your hypothesis and make real world connections. That is the fun of this whole project.</p>
<br/>
<p style="width:600px;"> To do this, you will need an understanding of the environment and the mechanics of each simulation round. At the beginning of each round, creatures are equally spaced out at the perimeter of a plane. Each creature's sole purpose to eat food. If a creatures eats one food they survive for the next round, if they eat two food they will reproduce. In this project we test the evolution of physical characteristics, specifically <i>speed</i> and <i>sight</i>. <ul><li style="width:600px;">Sight is the distance at which a creature senses other food. If a creature senses a food, it will mark it as a <i>target</i>. A creature without a target will shift its direction in a random direction after every step (the initial direction of a creature is towards the centre of the plane though). If a creature has a target it will move towards the target.</li> <li style="width:600px;">Speed is the rate at which a creature changes position. A faster creature is more likely to snatch a piece of food.</li></ul></p>
<p style="width:600px">Speed and sight come with a cost however, and this brings up the concept of <i>energy</i>. All creatures have a constant amount of energy per round. They will not move if they exhaust all their energy. <i>The round ends when all creatures exhaust all their energy.</i> You may notice the colour of some creatures may slowly shift, their colour — according to the gradient on the right of the screen — represents how much energy they are consuming. The energy cost is proportional to the sight plus the square of the speed (think kinetic energy).</p>
<br/>
<p style="width:600px;">In this project we use mutations as a spark of evolutionary change. When mutations are turned on and a creature reproduces, the new creature is similar to its "parent", but its speed and sight value are altered randomly.</p>
<br/>
<p style="width:600px;">There is a button to toggle mutations, the scatter plot will look nonsensical without mutations. The food count slider determines how much food spawns per round. The food dispersion slider determines how far apart the food is. Remember, the reset button is your friend.</p>
